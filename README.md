# KBP
This is the mini version of the KBP for Spigot/Bukkit, for use on the KelsonCraft server.    
Adds a few things that don't seem to be in essentials.

# Commands and features
  
Default group:  
<ul>

<li> Add localchat with the "@" symbol, put the symbol before your message and it'll be on localchat </li>
<li> Add /location command to view where you are at, possibly might allow this on other players too.</li>
</ul>

Admin group:  
<ul>
<li> fly command customized to put player on the ground so they don't die when flying gets turned off. </li>
<li> /lightning command customized to allow a number of lightning strikes which can be changed. </li>
</ul>

Possibly more features to come to the plugin soon!
